# Scaling laws for AIFS

This repo is based on the [Anemoi package](https://github.com/ecmwf/anemoi-core) from ECMWF. AIFS is provided in the Anemoi core repository.

## Installation

Install using the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t aifs:latest .
```

## Running Training

Run training using the SLURM batch script:

```bash
sbatch train.sbatch [width] [depth] [learning_rate]
```


### Configuration

The training script (`train.sbatch`) can be customized with the following scaling parameters:

- **Width**: `num_channels` (default: 512)
- **Depth**: `processor.num_layers` (default: 16)

### Example

To modify scaling parameters, pass them as arguments to the batch script:

```bash
sbatch train.sbatch 128 8  # width=128, depth=16
```

Or edit the default values in `train.sbatch`:

```bash
export width=${1:-128}  # Change width
export depth=${2:-8}    # Change depth
```

### Requirements

- SLURM workload manager
- Access to GPU nodes (4 GPUs per node recommended)
- Default Zarr dataset from Anemoi
